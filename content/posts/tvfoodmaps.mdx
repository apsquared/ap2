TVFoodMaps was actually an offshoot of a more complex app that tried to provide personalized restaurant suggestions.
A gimmick to draw some attention we realized that our list of restaurants featured on popular food TV shows like
Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives was really a hit, so we doubled down and created [TVFoodMaps](https://www.TVFoodMaps.com). 
This was way back in 2011 and the site has been going strong ever since.
