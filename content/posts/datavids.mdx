## (NOT) Coming Soon 

[DataVids](https://www.datavids.io) is a new website designed to help websites turn their content into viral videos, FAST.
The site is almost ready for prime time but in the meantime if you want to join our waitlist you will be the first to know when the site is ready.

## Going Open Source

After basically finishing the MVP of DataVids it became clear that the effort to make this a killer product, as compared to competitors was going to be 
pretty significant. Instead we are going to stay focused on [BarGPT](https://www.bargpt.app) and eventually refreshing [TVFoodMaps](https://www.tvfoodmaps.com).  
With that said, the code for DataVids should have immense value for people learning different technologies, so we decided to make the code available to people to learn.
If you have any questions about the code feel free to [reach out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/APSquaredDev).
