## Background 

Twitter/X recently changed how they display links in posts.  In the past meta tags for title and description (or specific twitter meta tags) were used when displaying
a link.  Users would see the title and description underneath the image from the twitter:image or og:image tag.  

[Elon Musk didn't like](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/4/23903859/x-elon-musk-headlines-links-image-twitter) the extra text and has removed the
text so only the image is displayed.

### The Problem for Developers, Bloggers or Content Creators

For websites, blogs and content creators this may cause a small headache as the images may not convey the content as well without the title 
and description.  For APSquared's site [BarGPT](https://www.bargpt.app) we didn't want to lose the name and description in our AI generated cocktails.

### The Solution

A simple solution we used for BarGPT was to use [Vercel's OG Image](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation) generation.  We got the idea thanks to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1710418965821039100).  After seeing how cool this worked out we decided 
to make the solution available for others.

Here is an example of a Tweet using our solution:

### How You Can Use It!

This is the best part, you don't need to do much to use our solution.  We provide a simple url where you plugin an image, title and description and we generate an image to use in your meta tags.

#### Image URL Format

```
https://www.apsquared.co/api/og?title=TITLE&summary=SUMMARY&image=IMAGEURL
``` 

Note: The summary field is optional.

Here's an example of the URL you would use for this [BarGPT cocktail](https://www.bargpt.app/aicocktail/the-pontiff-s-elixir):

```
https://www.apsquared.co/api/og?
title=The%20Pontiff%27s%20Elixir
&summary=Dark%20and%20mysterious%20cocktail
&image=https://heybairtender.s3.amazonaws.com/recipes/the-pontiff-s-elixir.png
```

Once you create that URL for you page/content you update your meta tags:

```
    <meta property="og:image" content=URL/>
    <meta property="twitter:image" content=URL/>
```

#### Image fit

One additional feacture we have added is the ability to control how your image is stretched to fit the OG image size.  

You can add a "fit" parameter with a value of either **cover** or **contain** to explore the different behaviors and what works best for your image.
