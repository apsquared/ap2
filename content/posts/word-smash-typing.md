Given all the hype on "vibe coding" I figured I would give it a try.  After seeing some other Indie Hackers build some cool 3d games I figured I'd give something a shot.  My kids and I used to play this typing game that was fun and helped them learn to type faster, it was called Typing Maniac.  I'm pretty sure the game was built in Flash and is hard to play nowadays.

Instead you can try out [Word Smash](https://wordsmash.apsquared.co) - the Vibe coding typing challenge!

## Vibe Coding Experience

I started first using Lovable.Dev to build the framework of the game.  Then moved it over to Cursor.  After a few days prompting and some debugging
I had the basics of the game working.  Spent about a total of 8 hours getting this going.  It's currently deploy on Vercel.
