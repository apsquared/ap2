GPTs are an amazing new way to experience AI first hand.  Here are some GPTs we've built:

## GPT Search

[GPT Search](https://chatg.pt/Search) searches all of the public GPTs hosted on ChatGPT.  It is not a directory of only submitted GPTs but a search of all of them.  Give it a shot.

## BarGPT

Just like our regular website, [BarGPT's custom GPT](https://chatg.pt/bargpt) lets you ask for new cocktail recipes for whatever mood you are in and creates you a recipe + image for that cocktail.  You can then continue the conversation and chat more about cocktails.


## TVFoodMaps GPT

[TVFoodMaps GPT](https://chatg.pt/tvfoodmaps) lets you chat with the [TVFoodMaps database](https://www.tvfoodmaps.com) of over 6000 restaurants on TV to help plan your next foodie adventure.
