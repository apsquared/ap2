Today, I'm excited to announce the launch of [LegallyVibing.com](https://legallyvibing.com) - a comprehensive search platform designed to help consumers navigate the complex world of legal THC products. This project combines my passion for technology with a growing need for clarity in the evolving cannabis market.

## The Farm Bill and Legal THC Products

The landscape of cannabis legality in the United States has undergone significant transformation since the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill. This landmark legislation removed hemp (defined as cannabis with less than 0.3% Delta-9 THC) from the Controlled Substances Act, effectively legalizing hemp-derived products at the federal level.

This created a fascinating legal framework where certain THC products became federally legal, provided they:

1. Are derived from hemp (not marijuana)
2. Contain less than 0.3% Delta-9 THC by dry weight
3. Comply with state-specific regulations

This opened the door for products containing alternative cannabinoids like Delta-8 THC, Delta-10 THC, HHC, and THC-O. These compounds offer similar effects to traditional Delta-9 THC but exist in a different legal category due to their hemp origin.

However, the regulatory environment remains complex, with state laws often differing from federal guidelines. Some states have explicitly banned certain hemp-derived cannabinoids despite their federal legal status, while others have embraced the industry with specific regulatory frameworks.

## Building LegallyVibing with AI

Creating LegallyVibing.com was an exciting experiment in "vibe coding" using CursorAI. Similar to my experience with Word Smash, I let the AI guide much of the development process through natural conversation and iterative prompting.

Here's how CursorAI helped me build the site:

1. **Frontend Development**: Through conversational prompts with CursorAI, I described the user experience I wanted and it helped generate the React components and styling. The AI suggested intuitive layouts and navigation patterns that I could quickly iterate on.

2. **Search Implementation**: When I needed to add product search functionality, I described the features to CursorAI in plain English. It helped generate the search logic and filters while suggesting optimizations for performance.

3. **Data Structures**: CursorAI was particularly helpful in designing the data models and API endpoints. By explaining the relationships between products, cannabinoids, and legal status, it proposed efficient schemas that were easy to work with.

The entire development process took about 2 weeks of "vibe coding" sessions with CursorAI, significantly faster than if I had coded everything from scratch manually. The AI's ability to understand context and suggest best practices made the development flow feel natural and efficient.

## Autonomous AI Agents and Data Collection

Perhaps the most innovative aspect of LegallyVibing.com is its data collection methodology. Using [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/), I built a system of autonomous AI agents that work together to gather, verify, and organize product information.

The agent system consists of:

1. **Research Agents**: These agents scan the web for new products, brands, and regulatory updates, creating a continuous stream of fresh data.

2. **Verification Agents**: These specialized agents cross-reference product claims with lab reports and regulatory requirements to ensure accuracy.

3. **Content Agents**: These agents transform raw product data into useful, consumer-friendly information.

This autonomous system allows LegallyVibing.com to maintain one of the most comprehensive and current databases of legal THC products available online, with minimal human intervention required for maintenance.

## Looking Forward

The 2018 Farm Bill is set for renewal, and potential changes to hemp regulations could significantly impact the legal THC market. LegallyVibing.com is designed to adapt to these changes, providing consumers with reliable information regardless of how the regulatory landscape evolves.

As the site grows, I plan to incorporate additional features like:

- Personalized product recommendations based on user preferences
- Community reviews and experiences
- More detailed legal guides for each state
- Integration with lab testing facilities for verified product information
