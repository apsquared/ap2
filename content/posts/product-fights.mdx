## What is Product Fights?
[Product Fights](https://productfights.com) is a competitive platform where SaaS products battle for the top spot in different business categories each week. 
Users vote on their favorites, leave reviews, and help crown the best tools in the industry. 
Unlike other platforms that highlight what's new, Product Fights showcases the most effective tools, giving top-performing products ongoing visibility and recognition.
